description: For Great Keynes, as for most English villages and towns at this time,
  secular affairs were so deeply and intricately interwoven with ecclesiastical matters
  that none dared decide on the one question without considering its relation to the
  other; and ecclesiastical affairs, too, touched them more personally than any other,
  since every religious change scored a record of itself presently within the church
  that was as familiar to them as their own cottages. On none had the religious changes
  fallen with more severity than on the Maxwell family that lived in the Hall, at
  the upper and southern end of the green. Old Sir Nicholas, though his convictions
  had survived the tempest of unrest and trouble that had swept over England, and
  he had remained a convinced and a stubborn Catholic, yet his spiritual system was
  sore and inflamed within him. To his simple and obstinate soul it was an irritating
  puzzle as to how any man could pass from the old to a new faith, and he had been
  known to lay his whip across the back of a servant who had professed a desire to
  try the new religion. Although written over a hundred years ago at the time of the
  Elizabethan persecution of "papists", it rings true even today where it is considered
  "with it" to denounce the Catholic Church.
